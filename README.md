# Retail Inventory Management and Sales Forecasting Data Engineering Project

## Overview
This project optimizes inventory management and sales forecasting for a retail company by integrating and analyzing data from sales transactions, inventory logs, and customer data sources. It aims to provide actionable insights for better decision-making and operational efficiency.

### Core Data Engineering Process
- Applying domain-specific knowledge to design and implement a data engineering solution.
- The project is tailored specifically for the retail industry to address inventory and sales challenges.

### Example Scenario: Retail Company
- **Objective:** Improve inventory management and enhance sales forecasting accuracy.
- **Data Sources:** Sales transactions, inventory logs, customer data.
- **Goal:** Ingest, process, store, and analyze data to support data-driven decisions.

### Additional Implementation in this project
- Experimented with data formats (CSV vs. Parquet) to optimize processing efficiency.
- Evaluate performance and scalability of different data storage solutions.
- Implemented Medallion architecture (lakehouse architecture) for scalable data processing and indexing 
  strategies.
- Integrate data from diverse platforms to consolidate insights.
- Considered cost-effectiveness and performance in all stages of the project.

## Step-by-Step Project Process: Retail Inventory Management and Sales Forecasting

### 1. Scope
**Business Objective:**
- Streamline inventory management processes and improve sales forecasting accuracy.

**Data Sources:**
- **Sales transactions:** Detailed customer purchases, product specifics, timestamps. Ingested from on-prem SQL Server to Azure SQL Database
- **Inventory logs:** Real-time stock levels, product movements, historical data. Ingested from Synapse warehouse to Azure SQL Database
- **Customer data:** Demographics, purchase history, preferences. Ingested data from Azure Database for MySQL to Azure SQL Database (through an pyspark, JDBC connection)

**Success Metrics:**
- Measured success through reduced stockouts, enhanced forecast accuracy, and optimized inventory turnover.

### 2. Design and Implementation

**Data Pipeline Design:**
- **Data Ingestion:** Utilized Azure Data Factory for scheduling batch data transfers. 
- **Data Storage:** Employed Azure Data Lake Storage (ADLS) Gen2 for scalable data storage.
- **Data Transformation:** Leveraged PySpark for data cleansing, standardization, and feature engineering.
- **Data Warehousing:** Implemented Snowflake for efficient data storage and integration with analytics tools.

### 3. Implementation and Monitoring
- Developed automated data pipelines for seamless ingestion and transformation.
- Established monitoring mechanisms to ensure data quality and pipeline efficiency.
- Tracked key performance indicators (KPIs) to measure the impact on inventory management and sales forecasting.

### 4. Advanced Considerations
**Data Format Optimization:**
- Implemented Parquet format for improved compression and query performance.

**Medallion Architecture:**
- Adopted a layered architecture for raw data storage, refined analytics, and dashboard serving layers.

**Distribution Indexing:**
- Utilized indexing techniques to optimize query performance for analytical workloads.

### 5. Conclusion
- Documented the end-to-end data engineering process for scalability and future reference.
- Demonstrated significant improvements in inventory management and sales forecasting through data analysis and visualization.
- Highlighted cost-efficiency gains and operational enhancements achieved via data-driven decision-making.

This project serves as a blueprint for building robust data pipelines that empower retail companies with strategic insights and operational efficiencies.
