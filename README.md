This project aims to optimize inventory management and sales forecasting for a retail company. The data engineering project will ingest, process, store, and analyze data from various sources including sales transactions, inventory logs, and customer data.

The steps involved are:

Define the Scope: Set clear objectives, identify data sources, and determine success metrics.
Design the Data Pipeline: Plan for data ingestion, storage, and transformation.
Data Transformation: Cleanse and enrich the data, and perform feature engineering.
Data Analysis: Transfer cleaned data to an analytics platform, perform data analysis, and visualize results.
Conclusion: Discuss the advantages, improvements, and benefits of the data engineering process.
Additional tips include documenting each step, testing the pipeline with a subset of data, and exploring additional Azure services. The project will provide valuable insights for better decision-making in the retail company.
